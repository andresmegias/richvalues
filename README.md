# RichValues

Python 3 library for dealing with numeric values with uncertainties and upper/lower limits, which we call _rich values_. With it, one can import rich values written in plain text documents in an easily readable format, operate with them propagating the uncertainties automatically, and export them in the same formatting style as the import.

This library require the modules `copy`, `math`, and `itertools`, from the Pythonâ€™s standard library, and also the libraries NumPy and Pandas.

You can read the user guide (`richvalues-userguide.pdf`) to learn how to use it.
